Example Gallery
===============

.. warning::
    For the purpose of these documents, animations are rendered as
    gifs and with a lower framerate and fewer frames to make them smaller.

If you run these animations locally, then they will be interactive.

Interactivity is available in Jupyter Notebook with following cell magic.

.. code-block:: python

    %matplotlib notebook


.. toctree::
    :glob:

    gallery/*
